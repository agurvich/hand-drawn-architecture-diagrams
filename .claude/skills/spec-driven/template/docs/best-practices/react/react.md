# React Best Practices — Agent Reference

> Token-efficient rulebook for LLM coding agents writing/refactoring React. Each section is self-contained; load only the sections relevant to the task. Rules are imperative; ✅ = do, 🔴 = don't. Defaults assume function components + Hooks, React 18/19.

## How to use this doc
- Find the relevant section ID(s) in the Index below.
- Read only those sections. Sections are deduplicated and cross-linked by ID (e.g. "see §6").
- When a rule conflicts with existing code style, follow the rule unless the user says otherwise; flag the conflict.

## Index

- **§20 Responsive design** — mobile-first; the project's `tablet:`/`desktop:` breakpoint vocabulary; responsive-by-default (utilities on one tree) vs. a justified separate-markup branch; the one viewport hook (`useBreakpoint`) is mount-gating only.
- **§21 Testing** — integration-style tests; render real hooks/children, mock only the AWS service boundary; one test per user-observable behavior (not per assertion); the shared `renderWithProviders` + `userEvent`; what belongs in a service unit test vs. a component test.

## §1 Purity
Components and Hooks must be pure. Purity = (a) **idempotent**: same inputs (props/state/context for components; args for Hooks) → same output, every render; (b) **no side effects in render**; (c) **no mutation of non-local values** during render.

- 🔴 No non-idempotent calls in render: `new Date()`, `Math.random()`, reading mutable globals. ✅ Move to an event handler, an Effect, or `useState(() => ...)` lazy init.
- 🔴 No side effects in render: DOM writes (`document.title = …`), network calls, mutating external state. ✅ Put them in event handlers (preferred) or Effects (last resort; see §9).
- ✅ **Local mutation is fine**: creating + mutating a value *within the same render* (e.g. build an array then `push` into it) is allowed. Mutating a value created *outside* the component is not.
- ✅ Lazy initialization with a side effect (e.g. `SomeLib.initIfNeeded()`) is acceptable if it doesn't affect other components.
- Purity is what lets React skip, pause, restart, memoize, and re-run renders, and run components on the server.
- StrictMode double-invokes renders in dev to surface impurities (§18).

## §2 Immutability
Treat all React inputs as read-only snapshots for a given render.

- 🔴 Never mutate props. ✅ Copy first: `const url = new Url(item.url, base)`.
- 🔴 Never assign to a state variable directly (`count = count + 1`). ✅ Use the setter (`setCount(count + 1)`) — only the setter queues a re-render.
- 🔴 Never mutate Hook arguments or Hook return values (they may be memoized internally → stale/incorrect results). ✅ Copy: `const next = {...icon, enabled:false}`.
- 🔴 Never mutate a value after it's been passed to JSX (React may evaluate JSX eagerly → stale UI). ✅ Create the final value before using it in JSX.
- Objects/arrays in state: produce a **new reference** to trigger re-render (`setUser({...user, ...})`, `items.map(...)`). Mutating in place keeps the same reference and React skips the update (§6).
- React detects change by reference (`Object.is`), which is *why* immutability matters (§16 FP).

## §3 State modeling
- **Minimal, complete state**: store only data that (a) changes over time AND (b) can't be computed from props/other state. If it can be derived, compute it in render — don't store it (§9).
- Test for "is this state?": unchanging → not state; comes from props → not state; computable from existing state/props → not state.
- Keep state DRY: store an array, derive its `.length`; store a `selectedId`, derive the selected item.
- **Where state lives**: find every component that uses it → their closest common parent → put state there (or lift higher / create a holder component). One-way data flow: state down via props, changes up via callbacks (§17).
- Prefer several focused state variables over one big object when fields update independently; use one object/`useReducer` when fields are interdependent (§7).
- To reset state on a prop change, prefer giving the subtree a different `key` over an Effect (§9).

## §4 Rendering model
- **React calls your components — you don't.** ✅ Use components only in JSX: `<Article />`. 🔴 Never call as functions: `{Article()}` (breaks Hooks, identity, reconciliation, optimizations).
- One-way (top-down) data flow: parents pass props to children; children request changes via callbacks passed down.
- **Reconciliation**: React diffs old vs new element trees. Same type → update props in place. Different type → destroy + rebuild subtree (and its state).
- **Keys**: give list items stable, unique `key`s so React tracks identity across reorders/inserts. 🔴 Don't use array index as key when the list can reorder/insert/delete. Changing a component's `key` remounts it and resets its state (§9).

## §5 Hooks rules
- ✅ Call Hooks only at the **top level** of a component or custom Hook — never in loops, conditions, nested functions, or after an early return.
- ✅ Call Hooks only from **React function components or custom Hooks** — never from plain JS functions.
- 🔴 Never pass a Hook around as a value, inject it as a prop, or build higher-order Hooks (`withLogging(useData)`). ✅ Call Hooks statically/inline; put conditional behavior *inside* the Hook.
- These keep call order stable across renders and preserve local reasoning.

## §6 useState
- `const [v, setV] = useState(initial)`. Setter queues a re-render with the new value.
- **State is a snapshot / async**: after `setV(x)`, the local `v` does NOT change until the next render. Don't read `v` expecting the new value immediately.
- **Updater function** for updates based on previous value: `setCount(c => c + 1)`. Required when batching multiple updates or inside closures/timeouts/Effects to avoid stale values. Three `setCount(c=>c+1)` → +3; three `setCount(count+1)` → +1 (batched, same stale `count`).
- **Lazy init** for expensive initial values: `useState(() => compute())` — fn runs once. 🔴 `useState(compute())` runs `compute()` every render.
- **Objects/arrays**: always set a new copy (`{...obj, k:v}`, `arr.map(...)`, `[...arr, x]`). Mutating + setting the same reference won't re-render (§2).
- The `set` function is stable (safe to omit from deps; §12).
- Move to `useReducer` when state grows complex/interdependent (§7).

## §7 useReducer
- `const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState[, init])`. Reducer `(state, action) => newState` must be **pure** (no mutation, no side effects).
- **Use over useState when**: state is complex/nested, fields are interdependent, updates follow explicit "business action" patterns, or many actions mutate state. Use `useState` for simple, independent values.
- Benefits: centralized transition logic, self-documenting named actions, consistent derived calculations, easy unit testing (test the pure reducer directly).
- Actions: `{ type, payload? }`. Use a `switch` on `type`; always `return state` in `default`. With TS, model actions as a discriminated union for inference.
- Keep reducers lean by extracting derived calcs into helper functions. Use lazy init (3rd arg) for e.g. reading localStorage.
- **+ Context**: split into a state context and a dispatch context, wrap in a provider, expose via custom hooks — gives app-wide state without prop drilling (§8).

## §8 Context
- For sharing data across distant components without prop drilling (theme, auth, locale, user prefs). `createContext` once; `<Ctx.Provider value>` defines value for its subtree; `useContext(Ctx)` reads nearest provider (else `defaultValue`).
- **Re-render pitfall**: Provider compares `value` by `Object.is`. A fresh object literal `value={{user, setUser}}` is a new reference every render → all consumers re-render. ✅ `useMemo` the value (and `useCallback` functions in it).
- ✅ **Split contexts** by concern / by change frequency (e.g. data vs actions/dispatch) so consumers subscribe only to what they use.
- ✅ Place Providers as low in the tree as possible to limit update scope.
- ✅ Wrap context access in a custom hook (`useUser`) that throws if used outside its Provider.
- For large/complex/high-frequency global state, consider Zustand or Redux; Context is best for simple, infrequently-changing shared values.

## §9 You Might Not Need an Effect
Effects are an escape hatch for syncing with external systems. If no external system is involved, you usually don't need one. Common anti-patterns → fixes:

- **Deriving state from props/state** → 🔴 storing it in state + Effect. ✅ Compute during render: `const fullName = first + ' ' + last`.
- **Expensive derivation** → ✅ `useMemo(() => compute(a,b), [a,b])`, not an Effect (§15).
- **Resetting all state when a prop changes** → ✅ pass a different `key` to the subtree, not an Effect.
- **Adjusting some state on prop change** → ✅ compute during render, or (rarely) set state during render guarded by a `prev !== current` check; best: store an id and derive the object.
- **Logic for a user event** (POST on buy, notification on click) → ✅ put it in the event handler, not an Effect. Ask: does this run *because the component was shown* (Effect) or *because the user did X* (handler)?
- **Chains of Effects** each setting state to trigger the next → ✅ compute what you can in render; set the rest in one event handler.
- **App init once** → ✅ module-level guard or run before render; don't rely on a mount Effect (it runs twice in dev).
- **Notifying parent / lifting state** → ✅ update both in one event handler, or lift state to parent (controlled component).
- **Passing fetched data child→parent** → ✅ fetch in the parent, pass down.
- **Subscribing to an external store** → ✅ `useSyncExternalStore`, not manual Effect subscription.
- **Data fetching IS a valid Effect use**, but add a cleanup `ignore` flag to prevent race conditions; prefer a framework's data layer or a `useData` custom hook (§14). Effects run after render/commit, so Effect-then-setState causes an extra render pass.

## §10 Effect fundamentals
- Use an Effect only to **synchronize with an external system** (DOM, network, browser API, third-party widget, timers, subscriptions). First check §9.
- Shape: `useEffect(() => { /* setup */ return () => { /* cleanup */ }; }, [deps])`.
- **Timing**: runs *after* render + DOM commit, not during render.
- **Deps array**: omitted → runs every render (rarely correct); `[]` → after mount only; `[a,b]` → after mount + whenever a/b change (`Object.is` compare).
- **Cleanup** is essential: clear intervals/timeouts, remove listeners, close connections/sockets, set `ignore` flags for fetches. Runs before each re-run and on unmount. Prevents memory leaks, stale state, race conditions.
- Each Effect = one independent synchronization process. 🔴 Don't bundle unrelated logic (e.g. analytics + connection) into one Effect just because they run together — split them (§11).

## §11 Effect lifecycle
- Think from the **Effect's perspective** (start syncing / stop syncing), not the component's (mount/update/unmount). Write how to start and how to stop; React calls them as needed.
- An Effect with deps re-synchronizes whenever a dep changes: cleanup (stop) with old values → setup (start) with new values.
- In dev, React mounts→unmounts→remounts once to stress-test that cleanup works. Make Effects resilient to being run repeatedly.
- Each Effect should represent one separate sync process; deleting it shouldn't break another Effect's logic. If it would, they belong together; if not, split.

## §12 Effect dependencies
- **Deps must match the code**: every reactive value read inside the Effect must be a dep. You don't *choose* deps — the code determines them.
- **Reactive values** = props, state, and anything computed from them in the component body (incl. functions/objects declared there). All must be deps.
- Non-reactive (omit/can't be deps): values outside the component, the `useState` setter and `useRef` object (stable), and `ref.current` / mutable globals (can't be deps — read via `useSyncExternalStore` instead).
- **To remove a dep, change the code so it's no longer reactive** — don't delete it from the array:
  - Read prev state via updater fn (`setX(prev => ...)`) instead of reading `x` → drops `x` dep.
  - Move static objects/functions **outside** the component.
  - Move dynamic objects/functions **inside** the Effect (so they're not reactive).
  - Read primitive fields out of an object before the Effect (`const {roomId, serverUrl} = options`) so deps are primitives, not the object.
  - Extract non-reactive reads into an Effect Event (§13).
- **Object/function deps are dangerous**: a new reference each render makes the Effect re-run every render. Primitives compare by value; objects/functions by identity.
- 🔴 Never suppress `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`. Suppressing it causes stale-closure bugs. Treat the lint error as a compile error and fix the code (§18).

## §13 Events vs Effects
- **Event handler logic is non-reactive**: runs only on the specific interaction; can read latest reactive values without re-running. Put interaction-caused logic here (e.g. send message on click).
- **Effect logic is reactive**: re-runs whenever a read reactive value changes. Put "stay synchronized" logic here (e.g. connect to room).
- **useEffectEvent** extracts a non-reactive slice out of a reactive Effect — it always sees the latest props/state but does NOT trigger re-sync. Use it when part of an Effect shouldn't react (e.g. read latest `theme`/`isMuted`/`numberOfItems`/a prop callback inside a connection Effect).
  - Declared with `const onX = useEffectEvent(() => {...})`.
  - 🔴 Omit Effect Events from the deps array (they're non-reactive). 🔴 Only call them inside Effects; never pass to other components/Hooks. Declare next to the Effect that uses them.
- Use it to avoid suppressing the linter when you want "react to A but not B" (§12).

## §14 Custom Hooks
- Extract shared **stateful logic** (state + Effects + other Hooks) into a `useX` function. Components express intent (`useOnlineStatus()`) instead of implementation.
- **Naming**: must start with `use` + capital. A function that calls no Hooks should NOT use the `use` prefix (make it a plain function so it can be called conditionally).
- Custom Hooks share **logic, not state** — each call has its own independent state. To share state itself, lift it up (§3).
- Custom Hooks re-run on every render, get latest props/state, and must be **pure** like components.
- ✅ Name after a concrete high-level purpose: `useData(url)`, `useChatRoom(opts)`, `useMediaQuery(q)`. 🔴 Avoid generic lifecycle wrappers: `useMount`, `useEffectOnce`, `useUpdateEffect` (they hide reactivity from the linter and don't fit the model).
- When a custom Hook takes an event-handler arg, wrap it in `useEffectEvent` so it isn't a dep (§13).
- Wrapping Effects in custom Hooks makes data flow explicit and eases later migration (e.g. to `useSyncExternalStore` or `use`).

## §15 Performance
- Default: don't optimize. Add memoization only after identifying a real performance problem.
- **`useMemo(fn, deps)`** — cache an expensive calculation between renders; runs only when deps change; must be a pure calc. Don't help first render; helps updates. Measure with `console.time` before adding (significant ≈ ≥1ms; test on throttled CPU / production build).
- **`useCallback(fn, deps)`** — memoize a function reference, mainly when passing it to memoized children or as an Effect/Hook dep.
- **`React.memo(Component)`** — skip re-render when props are referentially unchanged; pair with stable props (useMemo/useCallback).
- **React Compiler (React 19)** auto-memoizes much of this — manual `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`memo` often become unnecessary. Still useful for very hot paths, function/object props, or libs relying on reference equality.
- Note: splitting one state object into several variables does NOT reduce re-renders by itself; any state change re-renders the component.

## §16 Architecture & mental model
- **Declarative > imperative**: describe *what* the UI should be for the current state; let React do the DOM ops. Use `map`/`filter`, conditional rendering, and state declarations instead of manual DOM mutation.
- **`react` vs `react-dom`**: `react` is the platform-agnostic core (components, elements/Virtual DOM, Hooks, state, context, refs); `react-dom` is the browser renderer (mounting, DOM diffing/commit, events). Split enables React Native, SSR, Server Components.
- **React Elements** are plain objects (`{$$typeof, type, key, ref, props}`) describing UI. JSX `<div/>` → `React.createElement('div', ...)` → element object. `type` is a tag string or a component reference. Reconciliation diffs these objects; keys identify list items.
- **Functional-programming principles** React leans on: first-class functions (handlers, render props, HOCs), pure functions (predictable/testable/skippable renders), immutability (reference-based change detection), composition (build complex UIs from small components; prefer composition + `children` over inheritance), currying (e.g. `action => id => e => …` handlers).

## §17 Build workflow (Thinking in React)
1. **Break UI into a component hierarchy** — one component per concern; JSON shape often maps to component tree.
2. **Build a static version** — render from props only, no state; one-way data flow. (Lots of typing, little thinking.)
3. **Find minimal state** — apply the §3 "is this state?" tests.
4. **Decide where state lives** — closest common parent of all consumers (§3).
5. **Add inverse data flow** — pass setters/callbacks down so child inputs update parent state (`onChange={e => onChange(e.target.value)}`).

## §18 Tooling
- ✅ Enable **StrictMode** (`<React.StrictMode>`) in dev — double-invokes renders and remounts Effects once to surface impurities and missing cleanup. No production effect.
- ✅ Use **`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`** — enforces Hook call rules (§5) and `exhaustive-deps` (§12).
- 🔴 **Never suppress the dependency linter** (`// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`). It "lies" to React about what the Effect depends on and causes stale-value bugs. The linter only flags *wrong* deps, not the *best* fix — change the code instead (§12, §13). Treat lint errors as compile errors.

## §19 JSDoc component documentation
Document components with a JSDoc block so usage, prop meaning, and examples surface on hover in the editor. **This repo is TS-strict (§18/CLAUDE.md), so TypeScript owns the *types*** — use JSDoc for the *prose* (what the component does, what each prop means, examples), and let the `interface`/prop types carry the shapes. Don't restate TS types in `@param {string}` tags — duplicated types drift.

**JSDoc is the primary source of context, not inline comments.** This applies to every exported component, hook, and utility/service function, not just components.

- ✅ Put a JSDoc block above every exported component, hook, and non-trivial function: a one-line summary, then prop/param descriptions and (for components/hooks) at least one `@example`. This is what shows on hover.
- ✅ When code needs explaining, prefer expanding the JSDoc block over adding narrative comments — the doc block is discoverable (hover, IDE, generated docs); a comment buried mid-function is not.
- 🔴 No verbose or paragraph-length inline comments. Keep inline comments short, sparse, and reserved for the genuinely non-obvious *why* (a tricky workaround, a non-obvious ordering requirement) — never restate *what* the next line does.
- ✅ **Types come from TS, docs from JSDoc.** Define props as a TS `interface`/`type` (repo convention: `ComponentNameProps` in `component.types.ts` or co-located); annotate meaning with `@property`/inline JSDoc on the interface members, not with typed `@param` tags that repeat the type.
- ✅ Use **`@example`** (optionally with `<caption>`) to show real usage — the highest-value part for consumers; multiple examples are fine.
- 🔴 Don't hand-write `@param {object} props` / `@returns {JSX.Element}` type tags in `.tsx` — TS already infers them, and the tags fight the compiler. ✅ Keep `@example` and descriptions; drop the type tags.

Preferred form in this repo (TS carries types; JSDoc carries docs + example):

```tsx
interface ShopLabelProps {
  /** The name of the shop */
  shopName: string;
  /** Optional class name */
  className?: string;
}

/**
 * Displays a shop name.
 *
 * @example
 * <ShopLabel shopName="My Shop" className="highlight" />
 */
export const ShopLabel = ({ shopName, className = '' }: ShopLabelProps) => {
  return <p className={className}>{shopName}</p>;
};
```

- ✅ **Extend native element props** by intersecting your props with the right React attribute type, so consumers get `onClick`, `aria-*`, etc. with correct types: `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLParagraphElement> & ShopLabelProps`. For inputs use `React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>` (gives a correctly-typed `onChange`); spread `...props` onto the element.
- ✅ **Element-type reference** (for prop/return types): `JSX.Element` = a single element (typical component return; prefer over `React.JSX.Element`). `ReactNode` = the wider union (elements, arrays, strings, booleans) — use for a `children`/`fallback` prop that accepts anything renderable. `React.FC` / `React.ComponentType` = the *component itself*, for an `as`/render-component prop (`as={Badge}`), not an already-rendered element.
- If a **plain-JS** (`.jsx`) file ever needs typing without TS, the article's typed JSDoc (`@typedef`/`@param {ShopLabelProps}` / `React.HTMLAttributes<*>` intersection) is the fallback — but in this repo prefer converting to `.tsx` over annotating JS with JSDoc types.

## §20 Responsive design
The app targets three widths with **project-custom breakpoints** (SPEC-095), not Tailwind's defaults. The defaults (`sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl`/`2xl`) are reset to `initial` in `src/index.css` `@theme`; only two self-documenting prefixes compile:

| Tier | Prefix | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **Mobile** | base (no prefix) | `< 900px` |
| **Tablet** | `tablet:` | `900–1299px` |
| **Desktop** | `desktop:` | `≥ 1300px` |

- ✅ **Mobile-first.** Unprefixed utilities *are* the mobile (`< 900px`) layout; `tablet:` / `desktop:` layer changes on top. A prefix means "at that width **and up**".
- 🔴 **Never use a prefix to *target* mobile.** There is no lower prefix — mobile is the unprefixed base. (This is why the defaults are removed: a `md:` that secretly meant 900px is a footgun.)
- ✅ **Tablet-band-only** styles use the stacked `tablet:max-desktop:` variant (≥900 and <1300). `max-tablet:` / `max-desktop:` are also available.
- ✅ **Responsive by default (FR-008).** Restyle across breakpoints — spacing, direction, column counts, alignment, ordering, per-cell show/hide — with utility variants on **one** element (`flex-col` → `tablet:flex-row`, `grid-cols-1` → `tablet:grid-cols-3`, `hidden`/`desktop:block`, `order-*`, `gap-*`). Keep behavior, state, refs, and a11y in one place.
- ✅ **A separate component / `tablet:hidden` markup branch is allowed only when the two presentations are genuinely, structurally different** (different DOM/semantics, not just spacing) — the canonical case is the Files **data table vs. mobile card list** (SPEC-099). State the structural justification in the spec and still reuse the same data + shared child components/handlers (no forked logic).
- ✅ Two cases CSS alone can't express, which always justify a branch: **mounting cost / distinct interaction** (e.g. not mounting Monaco on phones — `hidden` still instantiates it) and **mobile-only chrome** (the `MobileActionBar`, the hamburger — `tablet:hidden`).
- ✅ Where a viewport hook is genuinely needed (**mount-gating only**, never for styling), use the one shared `useBreakpoint()` / `useIsMobile()` in `src/lib/` — not ad-hoc `matchMedia` per feature.
- 🔴 No `*Mobile`/`*Desktop` twin for a layout that is only a restyle of the same DOM.

## §21 Testing
Vitest + React Testing Library, jsdom. Tests describe **user-observable behavior**, not implementation. The goal is few, high-value tests — coverage comes from exercising real code paths, not from many shallow tests.

**The boundary: mock only AWS, nothing else.** Services (`*.service.ts`) and `src/lib` AWS clients are the app's only real seam. A component/feature/hook test mocks *those* and lets the **real** hooks and **real** child components render.
- ✅ `vi.mock('./x.service')` (or the `src/lib/*Client` / `awsCredentials` / `aws-amplify/auth` module it calls) and drive the returned `ServiceResult`. Render the real tree.
- 🔴 Don't `vi.mock` the feature's own hooks (`useFileBrowser`, `useDelete`, …) or stub its child components (`MoveDialog`, `MetadataPanel`, …). Mocking the internals is what makes tests brittle *and* fragments coverage (the mocked-out code only gets covered by its own file). One integration render covers the hook, the children, and the wiring at once.
- ✅ A child that is genuinely heavy/global and covered elsewhere may be stubbed **by exception**, with a one-line `//` why (Monaco editor, the upload dropzone). Default is: don't.

**One test per behavior, not per assertion.** A single `it` may make several assertions about one user-visible outcome. 🔴 Five `it`s for "renders name / size / date / order / icon" → ✅ one `it('renders a populated folder')`. Split only when the *scenario* differs (empty vs error vs populated), not when the field differs.

**Use the shared harness** (`src/test/renderWithProviders.tsx`): `renderWithProviders(ui, {route, auth})` wires QueryClient (retries off) + MemoryRouter + AuthContext and returns `{user, queryClient}`; `renderHookWithProviders` does the same for hooks. Inject auth with the `authFixtures` builders (`authenticated()`, `unauthenticated()`).
- 🔴 Don't hand-roll a `QueryClientProvider` + `MemoryRouter` wrapper per file — use the harness.
- ✅ Interact with `userEvent` (`await user.click(...)`), not `fireEvent`, in new/reworked tests — it models real focus/typing.
- ✅ Query by role/label/text (`getByRole`, `findByRole`); assert what the user sees. 🔴 No `data-testid` unless there's no accessible handle.

**Where a test belongs.**
- **Service unit test** (`*.service.test.ts`) — pure logic: request shaping, response parsing, `ServiceResult` wrapping, error mapping. Mock the SDK client here; keep these — they're cheap and exhaustive.
- **Component/feature test** — behavior a user drives through the UI, with services mocked at the boundary. Don't re-assert service parsing here.
- **Hook test** (`renderHookWithProviders`) — only for hooks with non-trivial state/derivation not better exercised through a component.
- 🔴 Don't test the same logic at two levels. If the service test covers a parse branch, the component test asserts the *rendered outcome*, not the parse.
