# Best Practices — Index

Domain coding rulebooks for agents. **Read this index first**, then open only the one doc — and only
the section(s) — your task needs. Each doc is a token-efficient, self-contained agent reference with
its **own internal index** — open the doc and read that, rather than trusting a section range
repeated here, which rots silently. Never load a whole doc you don't need, and don't load a second
domain unless the task genuinely spans both. This index is a **router, not content** — keep it to one
screen.

| Domain | Doc | Load when you are… |
|---|---|---|
| React (18/19, function components + Hooks) | `react/react.md` | writing or refactoring any React component, hook, state, or effect |
| Web accessibility (WCAG 2.2) | `accessibility/accessibility.md` | building or auditing any user-facing UI — markup, forms, keyboard/focus, color, ARIA |
| AWS Lambda (Python; event-driven, Step Function / Pipe / Cognito triggers) | `lambdas/lambdas.md` | writing, refactoring, or decomposing any Lambda function or its Step Function orchestration / IAM |
| Python (3.12; language style for Lambda source + layers) | `python/python.md` | writing or refactoring any Python — style, naming, types, exceptions, docstrings (layer over `lambdas.md` for Lambda *shape*) |

## How to use

1. Match your task to a **Domain** row above.
2. Open that doc and use its **own index** (the React Index, the a11y Task Index) to pick the section
   IDs you need — read only those.
3. If a rule conflicts with existing code, follow the rule and **flag the conflict** (unless the user
   says otherwise).

UI work usually touches **both** React and accessibility — pull the relevant sections from each, not
the whole files.

## Adding a new domain

- One file per domain at `best-practices/<domain>/<domain>.md`, written as a token-efficient agent
  reference: a short "how to use" + an internal index + imperative ✅/🔴 rules (match the existing two).
- Add **one row** to the table above and nothing more here — the detail lives in the doc, not the index.
