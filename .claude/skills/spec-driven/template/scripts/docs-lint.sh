# docs-lint.sh — hold the ALWAYS-LOADED tier to the shape the layering assumes.
#
# Why this exists as a script rather than a rule. Every check below already existed in
# prose — in `docs/process.md` §5 (*Anti-regrowth & doc hygiene*), in `CLAUDE.md`'s own
# doc-size guardrail, and in `docs/decisions.md`'s rules header — and in the sibling
# project `log-forge` (published as `log-foundry`) several were violated anyway. Its
# `CLAUDE.md` grew from 7,350 bytes at `ad898fc8` to 89,340 at `e60b60d`, more than
# tenfold — most of it while that repo carried only a TWO-SENTENCE version of the rule,
# naming no shape, no register and no budget. The full set landed two days before the cut
# and did not stop the next edit either. It was cut back to a digest over its register in
# the change that first ran this script there. Both ends are anchored to commits rather
# than restated: an earlier version of this comment carried three numbers, and two of them
# were wrong by the time it shipped.
#
# A rule a reader has to remember is a rule that rots. This is the same rules where a
# script can see them — run before every push, deliberately not in CI, so the failure
# lands on whoever caused it rather than on a shared branch.
#
# FAIL (exit 1): the always-loaded file is over budget or has been removed outright, a
#   Key Decisions unit has become the reasoning, the register is missing or has inverted
#   with its digest, an entry is unreachable from the Contents, a Completed spec has no
#   delivery doc, a delivery doc has become an essay, or a pointer out of CLAUDE.md goes
#   nowhere.
#
# There is no WARN tier: `spec-lint.sh` owns the soft per-spec judgements, and every rule
# here is a shape the layering depends on — a shape is either held or it isn't.
# Deliberately NOT checked here: anything `spec-lint.sh` already owns (required spec
# sections, banned headers, the FR ceiling). A rule with two enforcement homes gets
# qualified in one of them and read from the other.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/docs-lint.sh          (run from anywhere; resolves its own root)
# POSIX sh — no bashisms, no dependencies; runs anywhere /bin/sh exists.
#
# NOTE for maintainers: the awk programs below are single-quoted. An apostrophe anywhere
# inside one — including in a comment — closes the quote, and the shell then parses awk
# source as shell. That failed *silently with status 0* once during authoring, which is
# why `scripts/docs-lint-test.sh` runs `sh -n` on this file before anything else.

# ── Budgets ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# RATCHETS AT THE MEASURED LEVEL, not targets. When a doc grows past one, the fix is
# to move detail down a tier — into `docs/`, behind a pointer — which is the entire
# reason the budget is here. Lowering the bar to fit the edit is the failure mode, and
# it is how the sibling project reached 89 KB one justified exception at a time.
#
# ON ADOPTION, re-ratchet ALL THREE to what this repo measures once its real docs
# exist, rounded up a little. A budget far above the measurement never fires. The
# defaults below are deliberately loose because THIS repo ships a scaffold: its
# CLAUDE.md is placeholders, its Key Decisions holds one example line, and
# docs/spec-delivery/ is empty, so ratcheting them here would fire on the next edit to
# the template itself rather than on anything a project did wrong.
CLAUDE_MAX_BYTES=16000

# The whole Key Decisions section, measured as bytes. This is the guard that cannot be
# evaded by reformatting: a per-bullet cap is escaped by splitting one decision into
# five, and every shape that escaped the old parser still costs bytes here.
# (scaffold default; re-ratchet on adoption)
KEY_DECISIONS_MAX_BYTES=12000

# The longest a single Key Decisions unit may be. Measured on the LOGICAL unit — a
# bullet with its continuation lines joined, or a prose paragraph — because measuring
# the physical line looks equivalent and is not: the moment the section is rewritten as
# wrapped prose the longest physical line collapses to the wrap width, and the guard can
# never fire again while still being advertised in process.md.
#
# BYTES, not characters: awk length() is byte-based in the one-true-awk that ships on
# BSD and macOS, so em dashes and smart quotes count for more than one. Named for what
# it actually measures rather than for what would be tidier.
DIGEST_MAX_BYTES=1400

# A delivery doc answers "what shipped and what changed"; the completion template aims
# for well under a page. Applies to every *.md in docs/spec-delivery/, not only those
# tied to a Completed spec. Generous against that aim on purpose — it catches the doc
# that re-explains the code, not the one that ran a little long.

# ── 2. Key Decisions has a FIXED SHAPE, and is measured whole ────────────────
#
# This replaced a markdown parser, after that parser shipped three rounds of fixes and
# each round introduced a fresh escape: prose evaded a bullet-only cap; widening the cap
# to accept indented bullets let a parent-plus-children decision escape; adding boundary
# rules for tables, blockquotes and fences made every one of those a place where content
# was consumed and never measured at all. Eight escapes in the end, five of them
# regressions from the previous fix.
#
# The lesson is that this file's format is OURS. Parsing arbitrary markdown is an
# unbounded problem; validating a fixed shape is a bounded one. So the section may
# contain only four things, and anything else fails LOUDLY rather than silently sliding
# past a cap that cannot see it:
#
#   - a `### ` area heading at column 0
#   - a `- **Label** — …` bullet at column 0
#   - an indented continuation of the bullet above it
#   - a blank line
#
# plus free prose BEFORE the first area heading, which is the section intro. A table, a
# blockquote, a fenced block, an indented bullet, an ordered list, a task list and
# `__bold__` are all refused by name. That is not a limitation to work around: every one
# of them was an escape.
#
# The section is also measured WHOLE, against KEY_DECISIONS_MAX_BYTES. A per-unit cap
# can always be evaded by splitting; a section total cannot be evaded by reformatting,
# because every escape still costs bytes.
