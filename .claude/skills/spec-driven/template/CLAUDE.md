# [Project Name] — Project Memory

Loaded every session — keep it lean. Deep docs live in `docs/` and are pulled **on demand**, except
`process.md`, which is the contract this file summarises:
- `@docs/process.md` — how we work: spec lifecycle, session rhythm, completion ritual (**read every session**)
- `@docs/architecture.md` — system design decisions + Known Constraints (read the section you need)
- `@docs/decisions.md` — the Key Decisions register in full (the digest below is one line each)
- `@docs/specs/INDEX.md` — the spec index + status (one row per spec)
- `@docs/specs/SPEC-XXX-*.md` — the spec you're implementing
- `@docs/component-inventory.md` — reusable modules/services/components already built
- `@docs/spec-delivery/SPEC-XXX-*.md` — what a past spec delivered (pull only when a dependency points to one)
- `@docs/best-practices/INDEX.md` — domain coding rulebooks (React, accessibility, …); route here, then load only the section(s) you need

## Project Overview

[One paragraph: what this project is and why it exists. User/business intent, not implementation
detail. Understandable by someone who has never seen the code.]

## Layout

[Where things live — app/library code, infra, tests, docs. One line each.]

## Tech Stack

[Short table or list of the stack: language + version, framework, key libraries, test/lint tooling.]
**Don't add dependencies without noting them here first.**

## Code Conventions

[The non-negotiable rules: typing/strictness, error handling, naming, file/module structure, testing
expectations. Keep to what an implementer must not violate.]

- When writing/refactoring code in a domain that has a rulebook (see `@docs/best-practices/INDEX.md`), consult it first and load only the relevant section(s) — don't reinvent or guess the rules.

## Common Commands

```bash
# build / run
# test
# lint / typecheck
# spec-lint:  sh scripts/spec-lint.sh
# docs-lint:  sh scripts/docs-lint.sh
# docs-lint tests: sh scripts/docs-lint-test.sh
```

## Specs

Index + status: `@docs/specs/INDEX.md`. Each spec file's header carries its own `Status`.
**Current work:** [the spec in progress, or "none — next work unplanned"].

## Key Decisions (settled — don't re-litigate)

One line each — a digest of the full entry in `@docs/decisions.md`; read the entry before working in
that area. A line here is **never the only home of a fact**, and never a paragraph.

**Grouped by AREA, not by spec.** `scripts/docs-lint.sh` holds this section to that shape: an
`### ` area heading, `- **Label** — …` bullets at column 0, indented continuations, blank lines,
and plain prose here in the intro. A table, blockquote, fenced block, ordered list or bare bullet
is refused — each one was a way past the checks. Rename the area below and replace the example.

### (example) Area name

- **(example) Decision label** — the claim and its fence in one line, matching the `###` heading of
  its full entry in `@docs/decisions.md`. Delete this once the first real decision lands.

## Out of Scope (don't build)

[Explicit exclusions — things a reader might assume are in scope but aren't.]

## Session Workflow

**Start:** (1) this file, then **`@docs/process.md` — read it every session, not once**: it is the contract this file only summarises; (2) the spec you're implementing (`@docs/specs/SPEC-XXX`); (3) skim `@docs/component-inventory.md` for reuse and pull only the architecture.md section / dependency delivery-doc you need — don't read architecture.md or delivery docs in full. (4) Confirm CI is green on `main`; investigate failures before building. (5) Branch from fresh `main` — in a multi-agent run, in your **own worktree** off `origin/main`, never the shared checkout — and set the spec's `Status: In Progress` + its INDEX row in that first commit. (6) Generate an implementation plan from the spec's phases, validate it against the spec (FRs + acceptance criteria covered, reuse used, nothing out of scope), **send it to one fresh-context reviewer**, then build. (7) Send the **PR grouping** to a reviewer too, before the first push — as few PRs as the dependencies allow.

**During:** those two reviews are the only gates on *starting*, so **build straight through to completion**, summarizing a phase in passing but never ending the turn on it (a summary that ends the turn *is* a request for approval). Every file-changing task goes on its own branch and opens a PR — never commit to `main` directly. Specs carry no Open Questions — triage emergent issues by kind: **reversible/technical** ones you decide in-session (update the spec if scope changes); **product-changing or ambiguous** ones you stop and escalate to the human with options + a recommendation, never silently decide.

**Review — three artifacts, one blocking gate:** a **spec**, an implementation **plan** and a **diff** each go to a reviewer in a **fresh context** (new session or subagent), never the context that produced them. **Counts: one on the spec, one on the plan, two on the diff** — two *frames*, not two rounds, both before the push; the diff gets two because it is the widest artifact and the last one before the branch is public, one frame reading it against the spec's criteria + `best-practices/` and the other starting from the **system** rather than the diff. Both counts are **floors**, and they work differently: on a **diff**, a clean first review does *not* close the gate ("never exit on a round count" says when to stop *above* two, never below it); on a **spec or plan**, one clean review *does* close it, and what makes one a floor is that a revised artifact re-enters the gate as a new one. A spec is not Draft-ready, a plan does not start code, and **a branch does not reach the remote**, until every finding is either **fixed** or **flagged** — a rejection costs a sentence out loud, and only goes in writing when it carries a lesson worth keeping. **The diff review gates the PUSH, not the merge**, because **green CI is not a review**: it cannot see a test that passes against the bug it claims to catch, a lock taken in the wrong order, or an acceptance criterion ticked with no evidence. Cap same-frame rounds at two, then rotate the frame; exit on the *class* of finding shrinking, never on a round count. Brief the reviewer that "this is sound" is a valid verdict, make it cite where it looked, and tell round N+1 what round N fixed. On a code diff, one of the two must **build** the thing, not read it — and every reviewer runs the repo's gates against the branch. When the risk is what a change *removed*, enumerate the population with a sweep instead of reviewing a sample — but **a sweep has a frame too**: several sweeps that all ask the same question are one check, and the half of the change that was *authored* rather than moved needs a different one. **A gate is not tested by running it on the thing it guards**; it owes a fixture corpus asserting failure text, including cases that assert silence. Full contract: `@docs/process.md` §3 → *The reviewer contract*.

**PRs & main:** before pushing, get the diff through the review gate above, and get the formatter, linter, typecheck and unit tests green locally, plus `sh scripts/spec-lint.sh` and **`sh scripts/docs-lint.sh` — always, before every PR, since nothing in CI runs it** (and `sh scripts/docs-lint-test.sh` whenever you touch the linter). Watch every PR to completion and merge it as soon as CI is green — never open-and-abandon. **Key the watch on the current head sha** — a bare `gh pr checks --watch` can exit clean against the *previous* commit's checks. `main` is always watched: after any merge confirm it went green, and if `main` fails, diagnose immediately and fix it with a new PR before anything else. **When several agent sessions share this repo**, install `scripts/pr-queue/install.sh` once and the remote is serialised by a PR queue — one PR open at a time, taken in the order agents asked, `main` green before the next — and you get in line only once your gates and reviews are green, because the queue is not a review. Until it is installed the queue is inert. Protocol and the four commands: `scripts/pr-queue/PROTOCOL.md`; brief each session from `@docs/templates/multi-agent-briefing.md`.

**On spec completion — keep the always-loaded files lean:**
1. Set the spec file's `Status: Completed`.
2. Update the one-line row in `@docs/specs/INDEX.md` (status only — don't add prose).
3. Write a short delivery doc at `docs/spec-delivery/SPEC-XXX-<name>.md` from the template.
4. If it added reusable modules/services/components, add a one-line row to `@docs/component-inventory.md`.
5. A *new architectural decision* gets its full entry in `docs/decisions.md` **first, plus a row in that file's `## Contents`** (docs-lint fails an entry the Contents does not reach), then one line in Key Decisions above — the line is never the only home of a fact, and never a paragraph. If it supersedes an earlier decision, add an in-place superseded marker at every doc site still stating the old claim — and if the reversal changes the entry's **heading**, move its Contents row and its digest label with it, or the row points at a dead anchor and docs-lint fails.
6. If it changed the **shape** of the system — a piece added or removed, a boundary moved, a mechanism swapped — add an append-only row to `@docs/architecture.md` → *Architecture Decision Record* and fix the prose section it contradicts. Most decisions do not qualify.

**Doc-size guardrail:** this is the always-loaded file — if an edit pushes a section past a few lines,
the detail belongs in a `docs/` file behind a pointer. Same for `INDEX.md` (status rows only) and the
component inventory. **Key Decisions is grouped by AREA and carries fences, not history** — it is not
a per-spec changelog, and `## Specs` is not one either; both regrow by being appended to, one
completion at a time. **`scripts/docs-lint.sh` enforces this — run it locally before every push, it is not a CI job** — the byte budget,
the digest line cap, and the rule that every Key Decisions line has a full entry behind it in
`@docs/decisions.md`. A threshold can be invalidated by its own **success** — after a structural cut, re-derive it rather
than re-checking it, since a cap that can no longer fail is still advertised as a fence. The budget
is a **ratchet against accretion**: when it fires because the file grew a line at a time, cut and
re-ratchet, never raising it to fit the edit in hand. **After a structural cut the regime inverts** —
what remains is fences, so leave headroom and record why beside the number, or the next decision
that legitimately needs a line takes one from another area. Full rule set: `@docs/process.md` §5 →
*Anti-regrowth & doc hygiene*.
